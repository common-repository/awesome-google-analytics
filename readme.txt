Add Google Analytics on your website(s). The most simple way to add the Google Analytics tracking code on your website. For free.

== Description ==

This is one of the easiest plugins to add the universal Google Analytics tracking code on your website. We've added a few extra features, so your website Google Analytics tracking could be optimized.

= Universal tracking =

This Google Analytics plugins supports universal tracking, the newest version of Google Analytics.

= Demographics & Interests reports =

Enable demographics & interests reports tracking in the WP admin for this Google Analytics plugin. You may have to update your privacy policy for that, which depends on the country you're located in.

With demographics & interests you can track the age, gender and interests of your website visitors.

= AutoTrack =

Google Analytics has improved their analytics.js library. This enables webmasters to track outbound links and social media links. Google Analytics has partially fixed the session duration of each visitor with this new feature.

= Force SSL =

With Force SSL enabled, this plugin uses HTTPs to sent the data to Google Analytics. This is a lot safer than the HTTP protocol.

By default, Google Analytics uses the same protocol as your website. If you're running on HTTP, Google Analytics will use that too. When you're running on HTTPs, Google Analytics will use HTTPs too.

= Anonymize IP =

Your clients could not be tracked by IP address when this feature is enabled. Google Analytics will only store the first part of the visitors IP addresses, so it couldn't be tracked down into a complete IP address.

This feature is very helpful when your country has a strict cookie law for websites.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

Note: This plugin needs at least PHP 5.3+ to work as expected. PHP 5.2 is NOT supported. This plugin needs the PHP modules: cURL and filter.
